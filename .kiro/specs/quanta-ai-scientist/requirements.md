# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Quanta is an MVP multi-agent research system powered by Strands SDK that automates comprehensive research workflows through specialized AI agents. The system orchestrates five distinct Strands agents (Research, Data, Experiment, Critic, Visualization) to conduct end-to-end research analysis with advanced agent-to-agent collaboration. The application features a sleek modern frontend design and follows test-driven development practices with modular, shippable increments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to submit research queries through a modern web interface, so that I can initiate automated research workflows with visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a modern, responsive web interface with a research query input form
2. WHEN a user submits a research query THEN the system SHALL validate the input and provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN a research workflow is initiated THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress indicators for each agent's status
4. WHEN an agent completes a task THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the completion with visual confirmation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to see transparent agent processes and outputs, so that I can understand how the research is being conducted and validate the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent begins processing THEN the system SHALL display the agent's current task and progress in real-time
2. WHEN an agent produces output THEN the system SHALL display the full conversation history and tool execution details
3. WHEN agents communicate with each other THEN the system SHALL show the A2A communication flow visually
4. WHEN a workflow completes THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive view of all agent interactions and outputs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to orchestrate multiple specialized agents, so that I can benefit from comprehensive research analysis through agent collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research query is processed THEN the system SHALL initialize five distinct Strands agents (Research, Data, Experiment, Critic, Visualization)
2. WHEN agents need to collaborate THEN the system SHALL facilitate agent-to-agent communication using Strands A2A patterns
3. WHEN an agent requires context from another agent THEN the system SHALL manage context sharing between agents
4. WHEN the workflow progresses THEN the system SHALL coordinate agent execution in the proper sequence

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be built with test-driven development practices, so that each component is thoroughly tested and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing any feature THEN the system SHALL have corresponding unit tests written first
2. WHEN adding new agent functionality THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for agent interactions
3. WHEN updating the frontend THEN the system SHALL include visual regression tests and component tests
4. WHEN deploying increments THEN the system SHALL pass all automated test suites

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want modular, shippable increments, so that I can deploy functional features independently without waiting for the complete system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL be in a deployable state with end-to-end functionality
2. WHEN implementing features THEN each increment SHALL provide standalone value to users
3. WHEN testing increments THEN each module SHALL function properly in isolation and integration
4. WHEN releasing updates THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want cloud-agnostic deployment capabilities, so that I can run the system on different cloud providers based on my organization's requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL support multiple cloud providers through Strands tools abstraction
2. WHEN configuring cloud resources THEN the system SHALL use provider-agnostic configuration patterns
3. WHEN scaling the system THEN it SHALL leverage Strands SDK's multi-cloud capabilities
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL provide observability across different cloud environments

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive research workflow automation, so that I can conduct end-to-end research from hypothesis to visualization without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research hypothesis is submitted THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate literature review through the Research agent
2. WHEN data is needed THEN the Data agent SHALL automatically collect and process relevant datasets
3. WHEN experiments are required THEN the Experiment agent SHALL design and execute appropriate tests
4. WHEN results need validation THEN the Critic agent SHALL automatically review and provide feedback
5. WHEN visualization is needed THEN the Visualization agent SHALL generate appropriate charts and reports

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each backend task implementation to be immediately integrated with frontend components, so that I can visually verify functionality as I build and ensure seamless user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing any backend functionality THEN the system SHALL include corresponding frontend components to display the feature
2. WHEN completing a task THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the functionality through the web interface with visual confirmation
3. WHEN adding new agent capabilities THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the new functionality with appropriate visual indicators
4. WHEN testing backend features THEN the system SHALL provide frontend test points where functionality can be visually verified
5. WHEN deploying incremental updates THEN the system SHALL ensure frontend and backend integration is complete and functional
